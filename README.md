I'm @uvwso
I'm currently studying computer science.
This acc will be used for university projects.

I'm very new to programming. This is what i've done already:
- I created a discord bot, with litterly no usefull functions xD
- I coded a complete Minecraft shop/money system plugin with a database link to manage the players
  -> this plugin also includes a home system
- I tryed to build my own password manager in python but realised that creating a graphical interface is horrible with python and
  so i stopped working on that
